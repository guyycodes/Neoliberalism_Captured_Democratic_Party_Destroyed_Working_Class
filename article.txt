# The Great Abandonment: How Corporate Neoliberalism Captured the Democratic Party and Destroyed the American Working Class

## Executive Summary

**The transformation of the Democratic Party from a working-class coalition to a party of educated professionals represents one of the most consequential political realignments in American history, directly contributing to a public health crisis that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.** Beginning in the 1970s, Democratic elites systematically abandoned their New Deal coalition, embracing corporate neoliberalism through figures (https://time.com/7173651/democratic-party-alignment-history/). This policy shift—including deregulation, trade liberalization, and welfare reform—coincided with the collapse of manufacturing employment, union membership declining from 22% to under 12%(https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/union-membership-rate-fell-by-0-2-percentage-point-to-10-1-percent-in-2022.htm, https://www.statista.com/statistics/1357189/labor-unions-density-g7-oecd/,https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-9/forty-years-of-falling-manufacturing-employment.htm), and wage stagnation lasting five decades.

The human cost has been devastating. Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton documented an unprecedented "deaths of despair" crisis—suicide, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths—that has killed more Americans than the Vietnam War and AIDS epidemic combined(https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/where-despair-deaths-were-higher-voters-chose-trump-n906631,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318378457_Deaths_of_Despair_and_Support_for_Trump_in_the_2016_Presidential_Election,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/accounting-for-the-widening-mortality-gap-between-american-adults-with-and-without-a-ba/). **Counties experiencing the highest rates of these deaths showed a strong statistical correlation with Trump voting in 2016 and 2020**(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-018-4568-6,https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/infinity/article_share.aspx?guid=42449763-4227-4d51-a96c-aee166cef9f9), revealing how economic abandonment translated into political upheaval.

This crisis is uniquely American. While other developed nations faced similar globalization pressures, their stronger social safety nets, universal healthcare, and labor protections prevented comparable mortality increases(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26575631/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_of_despair). The Eastern European experience of the 1990s shows both the devastating consequences of rapid economic disruption and the possibility of recovery through appropriate policies.

**The path forward requires understanding that this transformation was not inevitable but resulted from deliberate policy choices that prioritized market solutions over community stability.** Reversing these trends demands comprehensive reforms including universal healthcare, strengthened collective bargaining, expanded social safety nets, and rebuilding the civic institutions that once provided meaning and security to working-class Americans.

## The collapse of the New Deal coalition

The Democratic Party's transformation began with the fracturing of the New Deal coalition in the late 1960s. **The coalition that had dominated American politics from 1933 to 1968 shattered under the weight of Vietnam, civil rights backlash, urban riots, and cultural upheaval.**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_coalition) The assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy in 1968 dealt what historians call "an almost fatal blow to the New Deal coalition prospects."

Structural changes accelerated the collapse. Big city machines crumbled after 1940, while union membership—the backbone of working-class political power—declined from 35% in 1954 to 20% by 1980(https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/its-not-the-economy-stupid-the-ideological-foundations-of-white-working-class-republicanism/). Manufacturing jobs relocated to Sun Belt states with weaker union presence, and the growing suburban middle class developed different political priorities than urban industrial workers(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal_coalition).

**Jimmy Carter, not Ronald Reagan, initiated America's neoliberal transformation.** As a member of the Trilateral Commission through David Rockefeller, Carter had unprecedented ties to corporate America. The New York Times noted that "Big business has the ear of Jimmy Carter, Democrat, to a greater degree than was true of Richard M. Nixon or Gerald R. Ford.(https://www.compactmag.com/article/americas-first-neoliberal-president/)"

Carter's presidency saw sweeping deregulation: the Airline Deregulation Act (1978), trucking deregulation (1980), and railroad deregulation (1980). The Depository Institutions Deregulation Act (1980) lifted usury caps, while the Revenue Act of 1978 lowered capital gains taxes. **Most significantly, Carter appointed Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve Chairman in 1979, deliunion membership declining from 22% to under 12%,berately choosing recession to fight inflation—a policy that devastated industrial workers.**(https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/01/matt-stoller-understanding-the-strategy-of-the-democratic-power-class.html,)

The consequences were immediate. Deindustrialization accelerated, eliminating high-paying industrial jobs. Real wages stagnated: the average full-time male worker earned $54,000 in 1977 but only $52,000 in 2017 (inflation-adjusted). Unemployment reached 7.7% by August 1980, with Black unemployment hitting 14.6%.

## Clinton's triangulation and the neoliberal capture

The Democratic Leadership Council, founded in 1985 by Al From, systematically moved the party toward corporate interests. **The DLC aimed to win back suburban white voters by distancing Democrats from their traditional constituencies—unions, minorities, and feminists.**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Leadership_Council) They embraced what they called "progressive neoliberalism," using market mechanisms to achieve liberal goals while rejecting the "transactional politics" of New Deal liberalism.

Bill Clinton, DLC Chairman from 1989-1991, embodied this vision. His 1992 campaign promised to "end welfare as we know it" while positioning him as a "New Democrat" rejecting old liberal orthodoxies. **Clinton's victory represented the culmination of a deliberate strategy to prioritize corporate support over working-class concerns.**(https://www.salon.com/2016/04/30/clintonism_screwed_the_democrats_how_bill_hillary_and_the_democratic_leadership_council_gutted_progressivism/)

Clinton's major policy changes fundamentally altered the American economy. NAFTA, negotiated by Bush but pushed through Congress by Clinton, eliminated tariffs between the US, Canada, and Mexico, resulting in a net loss of 700,000 American jobs while enabling threats of job outsourcing to weaken union bargaining power. The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children with work requirements, creating what critics called a disciplinary system forcing the poor into low-wage work.(https://jacobin.com/2022/07/democratic-party-neoliberalism-dlc-clinton)

**Most consequentially, Clinton's financial deregulation set the stage for economic instability.** The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999) repealed Glass-Steagall, allowing banks to merge with investment firms and insurance companies. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act (2000) deregulated derivatives trading, enabling the speculation that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.

Throughout the 1990s, the Democratic Party's shift from class-based to culture-based politics accelerated. As political scientist Thomas Frank documented, Democrats became identified with cultural liberalism rather than economic populism, while Republicans successfully framed cultural issues as central political divides. Working-class voters increasingly voted against their economic interests, drawn to Republican positions on abortion, gun rights, and traditional values.(https://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X,https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas%3F&_%28book%29=)

## The systematic destruction of working-class America

The policy transformation coincided with devastating economic changes for working-class Americans. **Manufacturing employment collapsed from 19.6 million jobs in 1979 to 12.8 million in 2019—a 35% reduction that eliminated the foundation of working-class prosperity.**(https://eig.org/manufacturing-rebound/,https://allamerican.org/research/manufacturing-jobs-by-industry/) The sector's share of total employment dropped from 22% to 9%, (https://blog.uwsp.edu/cps/2025/01/29/u-s-manufacturing-employment-a-long-term-perspective/) while entire industries disappeared: apparel and textiles lost 81% of jobs, computer and electrical products shed 1.1 million positions.

Union membership's decline accelerated this destruction. **Private sector unionization collapsed from 22.8% in 1979 to 6.9% in 2023,(https://www.epi.org/unequalpower/publications/private-sector-unions-corporate-legal-erosion/) weakening workers' bargaining power across all sectors.**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_comparisons_of_trade_unions) The loss went beyond economics—union halls that once hosted weddings, Christmas parties, and political organizing closed permanently. The United Steelworkers Hall Local 1190 in Steubenville, Ohio, exemplifies this broader pattern of community institutional destruction.(https://www.compactmag.com/article/more-than-a-union-hall/)

The most devastating consequence was the unprecedented decline in prime-age male labor force participation. **From 96% in 1960, participation fell to 87.6% during the pandemic, with white men without college degrees dropping from 95.8% to 84.4%.** About 14% of millennial males at age 25 are not in the labor force, compared to 7% of baby boomers at that age. These men often struggle with disability, addiction, and what researchers term "deaths of despair."

**The great decoupling of productivity and wages revealed the systematic nature of working-class abandonment.** From 1948-1973, worker compensation grew 91% while productivity grew 97%—near parity that reflected shared prosperity. From 1973-2020, worker compensation grew only 17.5% while productivity increased 61.8%. If productivity and wages had remained linked, median worker pay would be approximately $33,000 higher today.

Executive compensation exploded during this period. **The CEO compensation ratio increased from 20x typical worker pay in 1965 to 300x by 2013**, while real wages for non-college workers stagnated for four decades. This wasn't natural market evolution but the result of deliberate policy choices that prioritized capital mobility over worker security.

## The deaths of despair crisis

Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton's groundbreaking research revealed the human cost of this transformation. **Their 2015 study documented an unprecedented increase in mortality among middle-aged white non-Hispanic Americans from suicide, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths—reversing decades of progress and marking the first decline in American life expectancy since 1918.**(https://www.brookings.edu/articles/accounting-for-the-widening-mortality-gap-between-american-adults-with-and-without-a-ba/)

The scale of the crisis is staggering. If mortality rates had continued declining at the 1979-1998 pace, **half a million deaths would have been avoided between 1999-2013—comparable to lives lost in the AIDS epidemic.** By 2017, deaths of despair reached 45.8 per 100,000 Americans, more than double the 2000 rate of 22.7. These causes now average approximately 70,000 deaths annually, with some estimates reaching 158,000.(https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2023/08/12/suou-a12.html)

**The college degree acts as what Case and Deaton call an "inoculation" against deaths of despair.**(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318378457_Deaths_of_Despair_and_Support_for_Trump_in_the_2016_Presidential_Election) While death rates continued declining for college-educated Americans, they increased dramatically for those without degrees. By 2015, white non-Hispanics aged 50-54 with high school education or less had almost 1,000 premature deaths per 100,000. The life expectancy gap between college-educated and non-college-educated Americans widened from 2.5 years in 1992 to 8.5 years in 2021.

The crisis concentrates geographically in regions of industrial decline. **West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky show the highest mortality rates, with the Ohio Valley states accounting for 32% of excess deaths between 2010-2017.** Rural areas show death rates 19-21% higher than urban areas, with the most rural counties having suicide rates 1.8 times higher than urban counties.

Case and Deaton connect this mortality crisis to broader social breakdown. **They document "cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next," beginning with those leaving high school in the early 1970s.** Each successive generation faces worse economic prospects, creating "lives of cumulative deprivation" characterized by steady deterioration in opportunities, marriage rates, community participation, and social support.(https://www.brookings.edu/articles/accounting-for-the-widening-mortality-gap-between-american-adults-with-and-without-a-ba/)

## America's unique crisis in international perspective

**The deaths of despair phenomenon is uniquely American among developed nations.** While midlife mortality continued falling in France, Britain, Germany, Canada, Australia, and Sweden, mortality for US white non-Hispanic Americans began rising after 1998. By 2015, drug, alcohol, and suicide mortality was more than twice as high among US white non-Hispanics compared to people in the United Kingdom, Sweden, or Australia.

The Eastern European experience of the 1990s provides crucial context. **Post-communist countries experienced 3-7 million "excess deaths" during economic transition, with causes identical to the American crisis: suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and cardiovascular disease.** Russia's life expectancy fell from 70 to 64 years between 1989-1995, with 1.3-1.7 million premature deaths.(https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/mortality-crisis-redux-the-economics-of-despair,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-02-03/epidemic-despair)

But Eastern Europe recovered. **Central European countries like Poland and Hungary achieved faster recovery through EU integration and stronger institutions, while even former Soviet states eventually returned to pre-transition mortality levels.** The key factors in recovery were gradual economic reforms, stronger social institutions, and reduced alcohol availability.

Other developed countries avoided similar crises through different policy choices. **Universal healthcare eliminated financial barriers to care and reduced medical bankruptcies. Robust unemployment benefits provided income security during transitions. Strong labor protections made layoffs more difficult and expensive. Active labor market policies offered retraining and job placement programs.**

The contrast in social spending is stark. France spends 31% of GDP on social spending, Nordic countries spend 25%, while the United States spends approximately 20%. **Union density remains 68-70% in Nordic countries compared to 10.3% in the United States, with collective bargaining coverage of 50-90% in Europe versus much lower coverage in America.**(https://www.bruegel.org/analysis/collective-bargaining-associated-lower-income-inequality,)

## The political realignment and Trump's rise

**The connection between economic despair and political change became undeniable in 2016.** Columbia University researchers found that counties where Trump won had death rates nearly 8% higher between 2000-2015 than counties won by Hillary Clinton. Counties that shifted from Democratic to Republican between 2008-2016 had 15% higher age-adjusted death rates, with deaths of despair increasing 2.5 times more in counties with increasing Republican vote share.

Trump's victory margins were razor-thin: 77,744 votes across Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin gave him the presidency. **These states, which had formed the Democratic "blue wall" from 1992-2012, flipped due to working-class voters feeling abandoned by their traditional party.** The correlation between deaths of despair and Trump voting remained statistically significant even after controlling for population density, median age, racial composition, income levels, education, and unemployment rates.(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-018-4568-6)

**The Democratic Party's transformation into a coalition of educated professionals and minorities created new fault lines in American politics.** In 1998, 77% of Democrats lacked college degrees and working-class whites formed the party's base. By 2020, college-educated and non-college Democrats split 50-50, with college-educated whites (27.3%) exceeding non-college whites (25.2%) for the first time in Democratic Party history.

This educational realignment has profound implications. **Nearly half (48%) of Democrats now have four-year college degrees, with white Democrats' college graduation rates jumping from 31.5% in 2008 to 52% in 2020.** The median income gap between white and nonwhite Democrats doubled from $7,390 in 2014 to $15,428 in 2016, while white Democrats became 21 percentage points more likely to follow politics closely and vastly overrepresented among large donors (87% of $200+ contributions).

Republicans successfully positioned themselves as the party of "forgotten Americans." **The Republican Study Committee explicitly rebranded the GOP as the "working-class party," emphasizing voters "left behind" by globalization and cultural change.** Trump's anti-establishment rhetoric, rejection of "political correctness," and promises to restore American manufacturing resonated with communities devastated by deindustrialization.

The voting data reveals the magnitude of this realignment. **Penn State labor expert Paul Clark documented that Democrats lost almost 30% of working-class voters between 2008-2024: Obama won voters making under $50,000 by 28% in 2008, the margin fell to 22% in 2012, and by 2024 Harris lost this group to Trump 49% to 48.5%.**

## The multigenerational disaster warning

Case and Deaton warn that without intervention, the current crisis could become a "multigenerational disaster." **Those currently in midlife may age into Medicare in worse health than current elderly, creating unprecedented healthcare costs and social burdens.** Each successive birth cohort faces worse prospects than the previous one, with cumulative disadvantage building across generations.(https://www.brookings.edu/articles/accounting-for-the-widening-mortality-gap-between-american-adults-with-and-without-a-ba/)

The implications extend beyond individual health. **Future retirees will likely have higher healthcare needs and costs, increased burden on Medicare and social services, and reduced productivity and economic growth.** The loss of human capital and potential represents a permanent diminishment of American capacity.

**The crisis has already begun expanding beyond its original demographics.** Initially concentrated among white Americans, deaths of despair now affect other racial groups: Hispanic Americans have seen increasing rates since 2011, African Americans since 2014, with Native Americans experiencing the highest rates of all groups (241.70 per 100,000 in 2022).

Geographic expansion is equally concerning. **While initially concentrated in the Ohio Valley and Appalachian regions, deaths of despair are spreading to rural areas nationwide.** The most rural counties now have suicide rates 1.8 times higher than urban counties,(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db417.htm,https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20181210lifeexpectdrop.html) with rural death rates 19-21% higher than urban areas overall.(https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20181210lifeexpectdrop.html)

## Evidence-based solutions and the path forward

**The crisis is not inevitable—other countries avoided similar outcomes through different policy choices.** Universal healthcare could prevent 212,000 deaths annually in the United States according to recent studies.(https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2200536119) Nordic countries demonstrate that strong social democratic institutions can provide economic security while maintaining dynamism.

Immediate reforms must address the crisis's root causes. **Universal healthcare coverage through a single-payer system would eliminate financial barriers to mental health and addiction treatment.** Strengthening collective bargaining through sectoral bargaining could raise wage floors and restore worker voice. Expanding the social safety net with universal childcare, paid family leave, and housing support would reduce the economic stress that drives despair.(https://www.epi.org/publication/unions-and-well-being/)

**Community-level interventions are equally crucial.** Federal task forces should coordinate anti-despair efforts across agencies, with $12 billion annually in community grants for high-despair areas as proposed by the Upjohn Institute.(https://www.brookings.edu/articles/americas-crisis-of-despair-a-federal-task-force-for-economic-recovery-and-societal-well-being/) Social cohesion programs must rebuild the civic institutions—union halls, community centers, social organizations—that once provided meaning and connection.(https://www.compactmag.com/article/more-than-a-union-hall/)

The Democratic Party faces a fundamental choice about its future. **The Nordic social democratic model provides a roadmap for reuniting working-class and middle-class voters through universal programs that benefit broad coalitions.** Swedish Social Democrats governed for 44 years (1932-1976) by redefining socialism as "democratic influence over the economy" while maintaining pragmatic, non-ideological problem-solving.(https://nordics.info/show/artikel/social-democratic-parties-during-the-twentieth-century,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Social_Democratic_Party)

**Rebuilding working-class political power requires strengthening the labor movement as a foundation for democratic politics.**(https://www.epi.org/publication/unions-and-well-being/,https://www.amacad.org/publication/daedalus/unions-civic-engagement-how-assault-labor-endangers-civil-society) Universal benefits that unite rather than divide classes, place-based policies addressing geographic inequality, and democratic reforms reducing corporate influence are essential components of any viable solution.

## The generational stakes

The current moment represents a crossroads in American history. **The deaths of despair crisis reveals the human cost of prioritizing market solutions over community stability, corporate profits over worker security, and cultural divisions over economic solidarity.** The strong correlation between economic despair and political upheaval demonstrates that addressing this crisis is essential for democratic stability.

**The choice is clear: continue the neoliberal policies that have devastated working-class communities, or embrace the social democratic approaches that have succeeded in other developed nations.** The Eastern European experience shows that recovery is possible, but requires comprehensive reforms addressing the institutional foundations of economic security and social meaning.

The stakes could not be higher. **Without action, Case and Deaton's warning of a "multigenerational disaster" may prove prophetic, with entire regions and demographic groups trapped in cycles of despair that undermine American democracy itself.**(https://www.brookings.edu/articles/accounting-for-the-widening-mortality-gap-between-american-adults-with-and-without-a-ba/) The data documents not just economic decline but the destruction of the social fabric that supported working-class communities for generations.

**The path forward demands understanding that this transformation was not inevitable but resulted from deliberate policy choices that can be reversed through equally deliberate alternatives.** The comprehensive research presented here provides the foundation for evidence-based solutions that could restore hope, security, and dignity to the American working class—and with it, the stability of American democracy itself.

The time for half-measures has passed. **The scale and scope of the crisis—affecting labor force participation, union membership, wage growth, community institutions, and human life itself—requires comprehensive intervention matching the magnitude of the challenge.** The research is clear, the solutions are available, and the cost of inaction has been measured in hundreds of thousands of lives. The only question remaining is whether American political leadership will find the courage to act.
