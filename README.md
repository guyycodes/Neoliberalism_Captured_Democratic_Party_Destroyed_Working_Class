## üìë Content Sections

The analysis is structured into the following key sections:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of neoliberalism's capture of the Democratic Party
2. **Historical Context** - The shift from New Deal liberalism to neoliberal policies
3. **Neoliberal Policies** - Deregulation, privatization, and market fundamentalism
4. **Impact on Working Class** - Wage stagnation, job insecurity, and weakened unions
5. **Political Consequences** - Loss of working-class support and electoral implications
6. **Conclusion** - Assessment of neoliberalism's lasting damage to American democracy
